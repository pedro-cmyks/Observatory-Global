OBSERVATORIO GLOBAL - DATA SOURCES FEASIBILITY STUDY
Top 3 Ranked Recommendations for Iteration 2
================================================================================

RANKING RATIONALE:
All three sources have minimal authentication requirements, low implementation
complexity, global coverage, and real-time or near real-time availability.
They complement each other perfectly to create a multi-layer narrative signal.

================================================================================
RANK #1: HACKER NEWS (FIREBASE API)
================================================================================

================================================================================
COMBINED SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE
================================================================================

Three-Layer Narrative Signal:

Layer 1: EMERGING NARRATIVES (HN + Mastodon)
  - Real-time detection
  - Low latency (0-2 minutes)
  - High signal-to-noise (curated/engaged communities)
  - Best for early trend identification

Layer 2: VALIDATION LAYER (RSS News)
  - Mid-term confirmation (15-60 minutes)
  - Mainstream adoption signal
  - Cross-platform consensus check
  - Identifies narrative divergence

Layer 3: ANALYSIS LAYER
  - Narrative clustering
  - Engagement correlation
  - Cross-platform comparison
  - Trend classification

DATA FLOW:
  HN (20s poll) -> Normalization Layer -> Storage
  Mastodon (2m poll) -> Normalization Layer -> Storage
  RSS (15m poll) -> Normalization Layer -> Storage
  
  Storage -> Clustering Engine -> Visualization/Alerts

COST ANALYSIS
================================================================================

Development Cost:

  Mastodon Integration:  14-18 hours (engineer time)
  RSS Pipeline:          6-8 hours (engineer time)

  TOTAL:                 42-54 hours (1-1.5 weeks engineer)

Infrastructure Cost:
  Storage:   Minimal (depends on retention, ~50GB/month for all sources)
  Compute:   Minimal (polling agents, <0.5 CPU)
  Bandwidth: Minimal (<1 Gbps typical)
  Estimated: $50-200/month cloud hosting

License Cost:
  All sources: FREE (open data/APIs)
  All tools: FREE (open source)

================================================================================
RISK MITIGATION
================================================================================

Risk: API Changes
  Mitigation: Version APIs, maintain adapter layer, monitor status pages

Risk: Rate Limiting
  Mitigation: Implement queue + exponential backoff, monitor headers

Risk: Data Quality
  Mitigation: Cross-platform validation, outlier detection, manual sampling

Risk: Instance Fragmentation (Mastodon)
  Mitigation: Monitor top 5-10 instances, detect splits, aggregate carefully

Risk: Feed Discontinuation (RSS)
  Mitigation: Maintain backup list, detect feed changes, alert ops

Risk: Single Point of Failure
  Mitigation: Multi-source architecture provides redundancy

================================================================================
NEXT STEPS
================================================================================

1. APPROVAL: Confirm these 3 sources match Observatorio Global objectives
2. PLANNING: Create detailed 2-week sprint for Phase 1 (HN MVP)
3. SETUP: Provision infrastructure (storage, compute)
4. DEVELOPMENT: Begin HN collector implementation
5. VALIDATION: Test against real-time narrative events
